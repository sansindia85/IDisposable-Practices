# Demos - The WordCounter App

We'll run two versions of the demo app, finding and fixing disposable issues.

## Pre-reqs

The demo uses a SQL Server database and a REST API, which we'll run in containers. 

The easiest way to do that is with [Docker Desktop]().

## Setup 

Start the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Check they're running:

```
docker ps
```

## Run the app

> Open the WordCounter solution in Visual Studio and run the app
